# The Music Request System software

The Music Request System was officially conceived in 2015, and released to the public in 2017. It has been published to Github as the project has grown well beyond the need to have proper version control.

Note that while the project is now on Github, the primary source of information will remain on the website! Installation and upgrade packs will be published here for both major branches (stable and beta), but the changelogs and nightly build upgrade packs will remain on the main site.

Old releases are available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1LpD-cgOVpMNVl0Z2VEQjhia28
Other downloads can be found here: http://firealarms.redbat.ca/mrs/#downloading
