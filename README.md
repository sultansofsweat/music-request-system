# The Music Request System software

The Music Request System was officially conceived in 2015, and released to the public in 2017. It has been published to Github as the project has grown well beyond the need to have proper version control.

Note that while the project is now on Github, the primary source of information will remain on the website! Installation and upgrade packs will be published here for both major branches (stable and beta), but the changelogs and nightly build upgrade packs will remain on the main site.

Old releases are available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1LpD-cgOVpMNVl0Z2VEQjhia28

# About the master branch
This is the master branch. All development as it happens is published here. When components are completed, they are published to the "nightly" branch. Despite being called nightly, there likely won't be nightly releases; it is called such for lack of a better term. The beta branch contains tested code ON A COMPONENT LEVEL, but code that has not been tested as a system. The stable branch contains the final tested code.
